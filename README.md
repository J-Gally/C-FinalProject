# C-FinalProject
Personal Coding Projects

This was my final project for a C++ coding class. I coded a rudimentary game where you play as a character that can attack and move around 
to avoid enemies and obstacles that litter the map. I included collectibles and a points system to give the player an incentive to move
and explore. See how far you can make it, and try to get a high score!
